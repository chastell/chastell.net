Around 9 pm last Satruday I received a call from [Michaś](http://ecoutopia.org/) demanding that I show up in forty minutes at Moczydło Park to celebrate the annual Moczydło Ride event, which turned out to be all about throwing oneself down the side of a small hill on something specifically not designed for such activities. As you can see, there were more reasonable people as well.

Photomalcontents are to be informed that the colour of the snow is accurate and comes from the park’s artificial lightning.
