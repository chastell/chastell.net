Celebrating St Pat’s to the tunes of Hungry Grass. You’d drink as well.

(‘Anyone walking through hungry grass is struck by temporary hunger; to safely cross through one must carry a bit of food to eat along the way (such as a sandwich or several crackers), [and some beer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungry_grass).’)
