If you ever come near the Krakowskie Przedmieście Street or Warsaw’s Old Town, be sure to have some of the best [pierogi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierogi) in the world at [Pierogarnia](http://warsawvoice.pl/view/6558) on Bednarska Street. That’s me after a serving of Russian ones (i.e., with potato, fresh cheese and onion filling).
