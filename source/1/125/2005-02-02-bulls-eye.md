A Chinese sculpture of a bull from [Wei dynasty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Wei), ca. 386-557 AD, as seen in one of the antique shops on Krakowskie Przedmieście Street. The note said, ‘this very rare and well-modeled sculpture features a bull (Niu) with strong horns and expressive facial appearance’; there’s a chance it still can be yours for a mere €3,000 or $3,900.
