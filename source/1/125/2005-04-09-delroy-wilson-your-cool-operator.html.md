I’ve always been a bit behind when it comes to music, but discovering The Clash in 2005 might as well be the world record in this thing. I also listen to a lot of reggae lately, so there.

[It seems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_twin_towns_and_sister_cities_in_Poland#Warszawa) Warsaw and The Hague are sister cities; by the look of this photo you’d think it was Warsaw and Amsterdam.
