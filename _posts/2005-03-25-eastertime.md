**Tuesday:** roast the meats for pâté, <del>gingerbread</del>; **Wednesday:** pâté; **Thursday:** mazurkas[^1], gingerbread; **Friday:** aspic, meats, gray sauce[^2]; **Saturday:** pascha[^3], salad, meats.

At 3.15 in the morning I got the first slice of pâté for relishing; ‘delicious’ doesn’t even begin to describe it.
