One of the exercises at [Valérie](http://valeriejardinphotography.com)’s street photograpy workshop was learning to pan – set a long shutter time, follow a movement steadily and try to get a sharp person in front of a dynamic, blurred background. [Oberbaum Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberbaum_Bridge)’s cycling path is a prime place to practice.
